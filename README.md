# **NSFA-Net**  
**Noise-Aware Epileptic Seizure Prediction  Network via Self-Attention Feature Alignment**  

A nosie-aware epileptic seizure prediction network that aligns multi-layer features and maintains the contextual consistency, achieving SOTA performance.

This project provides the preprocessed Kaggle dataset, along with the code for model training and testing, and the trained model checkpoints.

## **ðŸš€ Quick Start**
### **1. Prepare Dataset**

We provide code for preprocessing the raw Kaggle dataset, which includes downsampling, segmentation, and STFT transformation. Use the following command to run the dataset preprocessing:

```bash
python Kaggle_preprocess_30.py --patient_id 1
```

Please download the raw Kaggle dataset via the following link:

[Download Link for the raw Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/seizure-prediction/data)

### **2. Run Training**

The code for model training is located at `script/train_NSFA.py`. Use the following command to run the training for patient Dog_1:

```bash
python train_NSFA.py --patient_id 1 --device_number 0 --data_dir Kaggle_dataset_30 --target_preictal_interval 30
```

Please replace `Kaggle_dataset` in the command with the actual path of your data directory.

### **3. Run Evaluation**
The code for model testing is located at `script/test_Kaggle.py`. Use the following command to run the evaluation for patient Dog_1:

```bash
python test_Kaggle.py --patient_id 1 --device_number 0 --batch_size 200 --ckpt_dir NSFA_ckpt_30 --data_dir Kaggle_dataset_30 --target_preictal_interval 30
```

Please replace `NSFA_ckpt` in the command with the actual path of your model checkpoint. We provide our model checkpoints, which can be downloaded via the following link:
